# Coming Soon
CalcOS is a simple x86_16 bit kernel developed by Tijn Rodrigo to perform math operations. The project is based on the MikeOS kernel, which is a popular assembly language operating system.

# Features

CalcOS is designed to be a lightweight and efficient operating system with a focus on math operations. Some of the features that will be included in the initial release are:

- Basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Support for integers and floating-point numbers
- A GUI interface
- A small memory footprint to allow it to run on older or low end hardware
